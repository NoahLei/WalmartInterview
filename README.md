Wade, our Java Technical Screener will be conducting your screening. 

This screening will be conducted over Zoom, you will need access to a camera on your computer/laptop for the video.  There is a live code share component to this screening that will be conducted over Zoom / IDE.  Prior to the screening, you will need to download / clone the following repository: https://github.com/alidadasb/apex-springboot-inventory

Please make sure this is done well in advance of the screening so we can mitigate any issues you might have with the download / build. I will give you a call in advance (day prior) to make sure you’re good to go and don’t have any questions.

 
Here is the Link to the Zoom meeting, please sign into this meeting 5-10 minutes before your scheduled screening to ensure you are able to connect:  https://apexsystems.zoom.us/j/4840716746?pwd=aVZSNUlFSXBHMy9MTGNpVkJFUEM5QT09
